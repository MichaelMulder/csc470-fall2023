I will create a farming sim game where a player will be able to plant and grow corps until harvest. There will be tools such as cultivators or fertilizer which will affect modifiers on the growth speed. The ground will be able to be cultivated, planted, watered, fertilized, and harvested. There will be two sections of the map one will be the farm and the other will be the marketplace. You will buy better upgrades in the marketplace and sell any harvested crops. 

The camera will not move and there will be no controllable character; instead the player will interact with the tools and ground directly by clicking on the ground to use a tool and the tool be selected by a button on the UI. There will be another button to switch to the Farm map or Marketplace map. There will be at least two currencies: one being money and the other being crop. There will be a max for each of them that can be expanded through the purchase of an upgrade or another building.

The story of the game will be that you(the player) have inherited a run down farm from your father. However, you also inherited his debt. There is no way to pay off the monthly payments with your current job, leaving making the farm success your only option. There will be an in-game clock and every month there will be a deduction of a fixed amount of money. You must make enough money before the end of the month to stay alive. At the end of a certain amount of months you will have paid off all the debt and will win the game.

Low-Bar:
Basic game functions with only planting and harvesting working, only farm map available but can still buy seeds and sell crops. Limited amount of upgrades. Monthly deductions still working. Audio will be a simple looped song which plays over gameplay. Visuals will be basic unity objects with little to know animation. 
Target:
Game completely functions with more advanced tools. Harvesting, planting, cultivating, fertilizing and watering are all working. Marketplace will be larger with more shops specialized in selling specific items. More upgrades and buildings. Visuals will use pre-made prefabs from poly pizza with a moderate amount of animation. Audio will be a song which plays throughout gameplay with some extra audio functionality which plays on certain triggers.
High-Bar:
Completely functioning game with up to five different crops, crops will all be sold and bought at different prices which will fluctuate depending on time and if you sold or bought crops before.
Marketplace will have multiple shops to buy upgrades, improved tools, and materials. There will be multiple materials you can purchase which will be used to build buildings which will have different upgrades associated with them. Visually detailed game using many pre-built models. Pleasing audio song though the entire game with audio cues throughout the game.
